## Introduction

The ArambhGPT AI Core System is a sophisticated emotional intelligence platform designed specifically for South Asian mental health support. The system implements a research-validated four-stage comfort provision framework: Recognition, Resonance, Response, and Resolution. It integrates OpenAI GPT-4 with custom cultural intelligence models to provide culturally sensitive, therapeutically appropriate responses that guide users toward sukoon (peace) and arambh (new beginning).

**User Story:** As a user working through emotional challenges, I want the AI to guide me toward resolution and peace, so that I can achieve emotional stability and closure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessing progress THEN the system SHALL evaluate movement toward emotional stability
2. WHEN providing closure THEN the system SHALL offer peace-making techniques and resolution guidance
3. WHEN ensuring support THEN the system SHALL confirm the user feels heard and validated

5. WHEN measuring sukoon improvement THEN the system SHALL track emotional progress quantitatively

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mental health professional, I want the AI to integrate seamlessly with OpenAI GPT-4 while maintaining cultural intelligence, so that users receive the best of both advanced AI and cultural sensitivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL integrate OpenAI GPT-4 with custom emotional intelligence models
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL ensure cultural sensitivity to Indian/South Asian contexts
3. WHEN providing therapeutic guidance THEN the system SHALL maintain evidence-based therapeutic appropriateness
4. WHEN detecting crisis situations THEN the system SHALL escalate appropriately to human professionals
5. WHEN optimizing responses THEN the system SHALL focus on sukoon and arambh conceptual frameworks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive effectiveness measurement and optimization capabilities, so that the AI system continuously improves its cultural adaptation and therapeutic outcomes.
